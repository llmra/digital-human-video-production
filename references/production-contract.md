# Production contract

This is the small, reviewable contract that keeps a presenter-led product video
reproducible. It defines the shape of a project without prescribing a client's
topic, copy, visual identity, or provider.

```

Raw audio, provider outputs, captured customer pages, fonts with unclear
redistribution rights, `.env` files, and unredacted job logs remain local. Commit
schemas, templates, redacted manifests, and QC evidence — not private media.

## Approval gates

1. **Brief gate** — audience, promise, claims, source links, brand tokens,
   delivery target, and risk constraints are identified.
2. **Voice gate** — one narration candidate is approved by listening; the chosen
   WAV, generation settings, and checksum are recorded.
3. **Presenter gate** — a short preview is approved for cadence, expression,
   eye contact, lip sync, crop, and freeze behavior. The approval references the
   locked audio checksum and authorizes at most one full-master generation.
4. **Timeline gate** — scene boundaries, captions, page captures, and presenter
   schedule all use the locked voice clock.
5. **Delivery gate** — technical, visual, audio, provenance, and checksum checks
   pass; known limitations are explicitly recorded.

The workflow may continue after a failed gate only with a `preview` or
`candidate` label. A later voice or claim change reopens downstream gates. Keep
provider events append-only; local layout revisions reuse the completed master.

## Claim and asset discipline

Use a source table for every load-bearing claim: source URL/path, retrieval date,
claim owner, and the exact on-screen wording. Mark illustrative UI as such and
never present a fabricated provider screen as a verified product fact. Track
font, logo, screenshot, music, SFX, and model rights separately; the public skill
does not grant rights to a project's assets.

## Variation points

Projects may replace the voice engine, avatar provider, motion renderer,
compositor, language, aspect ratio, caption style, or PIP geometry. Preserve the
invariants: one timing authority, explicit approvals, local composition, source
provenance, and a machine-readable final QC report.

`reference_stack` is an implementation note, not a content field. Keep it
explicit when using the documented VoxCPM → HeyGen → HyperFrames + GSAP →
Remotion path; update it when a project selects an alternative. Never place a product
brand, customer page, provider credential, or private asset ID in the public
skill manifest.
